MCUboot is pleased to welcome Golioth as a new member!

Golioth is a platform that allows device makers to deliver on the promise of cloud connected IoT. It enables hardware developers to build secure end-to-end IoT-connected products using their choice of hardware and connectivity, all without the need for a team of cloud engineers. From device messaging to security, updates, analytics, and more, the platform provides device services that work with every developer's hardware and firmware requirements.

Golioth believes it is essential to standardize the key component of any embedded system, the bootloader. If there isn’t one industry standard, companies are forced to support various custom bootloaders which results in more engineering effort and cost for all. Multiple implementations also means more chances to get security wrong. This is why Golioth has chosen to join the MCUboot project to help drive the standardization of a much needed universal and secure bootloader.

“We believe IoT should be secure by default and the security of a device starts at the bootloader,” says Jonathan Beri, CEO of Golioth. “Does every company really need to reinvent the humble bootloader each time, instead of focusing on differentiated features? Should they also toil on unbrickable, always updatable and securable low-level software? We believe not, and are excited to be involved in making MCUBoot become the standard in secure, reliable bootloaders for IoT.”
