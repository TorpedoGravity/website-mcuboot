### About MCUboot

MCUboot is operating system and hardware independent and relies on hardware porting layers from the 
operating system it works with. Currently MCUboot works with both the Apache Mynewt, and Zephyr operating 
systems, but more ports are planned in the future. RIOT is currently supported as a boot target with a complete 
port planned. MCUboot is an open governance project.

### Roadmap
The issues being planned and worked on are tracked using GitHub issues. 
To participate please visit [MCUboot Issues on github](https://github.com/mcu-tools/mcuboot/issues).
